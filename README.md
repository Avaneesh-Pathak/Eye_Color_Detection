## Introduction

The eye color detection project aims to accurately identify eyes in images and predict their color using machine learning algorithms. The model combines image processing techniques, such as image segmentation and feature extraction, with computer vision algorithms to achieve high accuracy in eye detection and color prediction.

## Installation

To install and set up the eye color detection project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avaneesh-Pathak/Eye_Color_Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Eye_Color_Detection
   ```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the eye color detection model:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Place the images you want to analyze in the `images` directory within the project folder.
3. Run the `eye_color_detection.py` script:
   ```
   python eye_color_detection.py
   ```
4. The script will process the images, detect eyes, and predict their color.
5. The results, including the detected eyes and their predicted color, will be displayed or saved depending on the script implementation.

## Model Training

If you are interested in training the eye color detection model using your own dataset or improving the existing model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a dataset of eye images with corresponding eye color labels.
2. Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your requirements.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and make any necessary adjustments to improve accuracy.

## Dataset

The eye color detection model requires a labeled dataset of eye images with corresponding eye color labels. If you don't have a dataset, you can utilize publicly available eye image datasets or create your own by collecting and labeling eye images.

Ensure that your dataset contains a sufficient number of eye images representing different eye colors to achieve accurate predictions.

## Results

The eye color detection model will provide results based on the analysis of the provided images. The results may include the following:

- Detected eyes in the input images
- Predicted eye colors for each detected eye
- Confidence levels or probabilities associated with each predicted eye color

Please review the output carefully and assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
